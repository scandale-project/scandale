# SCANDALE

## Presentation

[SCANDALE](https://github.com/scandale-project/scandale),
is a libre software which is providing a backend architecture
for collecting data from probes and storing proof of checks.

The platform is composed of:

- a documented HTTP API with a PubSub mechansim and a connection to a
  database;
- a backend to deploy and monitor a network of probes.
  The architecture is relying on the
  [Smart Python Agent Development Environment](https://github.com/javipalanca/spade);
- a service to timestamp the collected data with a third party
  ([RFC 3161](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt)) for the proof of checks.

The API is based on the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) framework
well known for its excellent performance.

It is possible to extend the platform in order to share data with external
system, such as MISP.


### Use-case

- following a notification, an SME ask its provider to patch a system. The
  provider says the system is patched at a given date, but lies. The SME can
  then check the certified scan logs to break its contract with the provider;
- certification of incident timeline.


### High-level architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR

P[Probe] -->|Standardized result| A(Aggregation Engine)
P1[Probe] -->|Standardized result| A
P2[Probe] -->|Standardized result| A

A -.->|Ask for a timestamp| RTS(Third party timestamper)

P -.-> H[Agents registry]
P1 -.-> H
P2 -.-> H
A -.-> H

A -->|HTTP POST| B[FastAPI]
B -.->|Ask for a timestamp| RTS
B -->|Write| G[Database]
E[External source] -->|HTTP POST| B
```

Each probe agent is authenticated, registered and declare its availability
(for the presence notification system). The OMEMO protocol can be used for
communications between agents.
